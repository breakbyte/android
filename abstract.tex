	With the development technology, the amount of data people contact is increasing day by day, and the problem of information overload is becoming more and more prominent. Recommender system can help users find the information they are interested in, and plays a more and more important role in people's life. Due to the wide application of recommender system, attacks against recommender system are also emerging one after another.
	
	In this work, we study the data poisoning attack of recommender system based on deep learning. By injecting the carefully crafted fake users into the recommender system, the attacker can recommend the target items selected by the attacker to as many users as possible. The challenge of implementing the attack is that we need to solve an optimization problem so that the injected ratings of fake user can recommend the target item to normal users to the greatest extent.We develop a new attack method to solve the above problems. Our experimental results show that our attack is effective on real-world datasets and better than our baseline attack and existing attacks.
